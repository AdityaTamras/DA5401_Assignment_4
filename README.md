# DA5401_Assignment_4

The GitHub repo for the Assignment 4 of DA5401 : Data Analytics Lab. The Jupyter notebook A4_code_DA5401.ipynb contains the code, plots and subjective answers to the questions. The aim of the assignment is to create a training set that allows a classifier to learn the nuances of the minority (fraudulent) class without overfitting or misclassifying. This explores GMM-based oversampling to achieve the same.
